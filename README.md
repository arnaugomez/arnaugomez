a Frontend Engineer with 5 years of experience building web & mobile applications.

## Why so little activity on GitHub?

It is because of my work schedule.

- From 8:00 to 16:30 I work at my job as a Software Engineer.
- From 16:30 to 20:00 I study Computer Science.
- Any spare time is devoted to my YouTube channel.

Neither my work nor my Computer Science projects can be published on GitHub because I am not allowed to - they are not my property.

However, I love open source and staying informed of the latest tech news. Once I finish my studies, you will see much more activity here.
